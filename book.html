There are only three women in front of whom i can bow without any hasitation one is my Mother second is my sister and at last third is the person i worship after my mom Named as Vaishnavi Walunj. So how this happen a boy who dont have feelings for any girl and who call every girl like his sister fallen a girl of MCA by just a glance of her ? The answer is love at first sight he saw her at the desk of isuence chember. That day he experinced all the feelings that he havent experienced in entire life.

            sparkle in your eyes to the warmth in your smile, everything about
            you seems flawless. Honestly, sometimes it feels like you were
            created as a masterpiece, carefully designed to brighten the world.

            Beyond the surface, what truly stands out is your dedication, hard
            work, and passion. You're not just someone to admire for your looks,
            but an inspiration. Seeing how driven and focused you are in
            everything you do makes me respect you even more. I believe you

            conversation. You're not just great to look at; your personality
            makes you even more special.
